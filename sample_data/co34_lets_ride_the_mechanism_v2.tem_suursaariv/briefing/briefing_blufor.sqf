<br/>
Platoon, shit is fucked up totally hard. We're the last unit on this island that has been taken over by CSAT. 
Our only way out is to make it from our temporary base in Suurkyla to a boat all the way in Kiiskinkyla.
Luckily, there is one single road left on the entire island that hasn't been completely blocked off by CSAT armor. However, CSAT recon forces have set up ambushes all along the route.
However, we have no choice, as there is a CSAT air strike inbound to destroy our base. We are a supply platoon, so the only armored vehicles we have are these 50 year old humvees, but they'll have to do.
<br/><br/>

<font size='18'>ENEMY FORCES</font>
<br/>
CSAT Recon light infantry. Expect a lot of them but they won't be heavily armed, and we're not expecting any vehicles.

You are equipped with light armored humvees equipped with M2s. Take your pick of what you want. They are resistant but not immune to small arms fire, and the windows can be rolled down and shot out of.
